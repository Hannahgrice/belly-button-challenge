# belly-button-challenge\Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
This project explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, cataloging microbes found in human navels. I created an interactive dashboard to visualize this data.

Getting Started
Created a new repo called belly-button-challenge and cloned it.
Added the starter files: index.html, samples.json, and the static folder.
Pushed the changes to GitHub.
Features
Bar Chart: Shows the top 10 OTUs for a selected individual using sample_values, otu_ids, and otu_labels.
Bubble Chart: Displays samples with otu_ids on the x-axis, sample_values on the y-axis, and uses sample_values and otu_ids for marker sizes and colors, respectively.
Metadata Panel: Displays demographic info for the selected individual.
The charts update when a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu.

Deployment
Deployed the app to GitHub Pages.
